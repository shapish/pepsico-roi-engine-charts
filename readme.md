## Notes

-   The data review charts javascript is a little hard to reverse engineer, with the report charts I made a greater effort to keep things simple. All chart objects there are listed verbatim within the "\_setCharts" function.
-   The primary goal of this document was to generate the charts so I could include them in Sketch. Hence there is a lot of repetition with only minor differences.
